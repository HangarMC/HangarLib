## Contributing

If you want to edit something in this repository for use in Hangar/HangarAuth, it is usually easier to commit changes in
the submodule where this is included and to then push the changes to a remote fork. To do that, cd into the submodule's
directory, switch to or create a branch (`git switch master`), add your GitHub fork as a
remote (`git remote add fork <fork url>`) and push your code changes to it.
